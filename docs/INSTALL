# Installation

Copy the custom kernel tar.xz archive to your Raspberry Pi, and use
the `tar` command to extract the archive. In the example, the archive
we will be using is called `re4son-kernel_4.9.28-20170618.tar.xz`. Replace
the name of the example archive with the name of the pitft kernel
tar.gz archive.

```
$ tar -xJf re4son-kernel_4.9.28-20170618.tar.xz
```

You can now `cd` into the extracted folder. The extracted
folder will have the same name as the archive, minus the
.tar.xz suffix.

```
$ cd re4son-kernel_4.9.28-20170618
```

Now you are ready to run the install script. **Warning!** *Installing
a broken kernel can render your Raspberry Pi unusable. Please backup
your SD card before continuing.*

```
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

If you see an error message, the kernel install failed. If everything goes
well, you will see this message: **Kernel install complete!**. You will
need to reboot for the changes to take effect but you can continue with the 
setup of your screen and reboot later.

Just press "N" when prompted to reboot and continue with the setup of your TFT screen.

You can now run the Re4son Universal TFT Setup Tool to configure the system for your TFT screen.
The command syntax is:

```
$ sudo ./re4son-pi-tft-setup -t <type>
```

The following types are supported:

'28r'      (Adafruit 2.8" PID 1601)
'28c'      (Adafruit 2.8" PID 1983)
'35r'      (Adafruit 3.5")
'22'       (Adafruit 2.2")
'elec22'   (Elecfreak 2.2")
'jb35'     (JBTek 3.5")
'sain32'   (Sainsmart 3.2")
'wave32'   (Waveshare 3.2")
'wave35'   (Waveshare 3.5")

Example command for setting up an Adafruit PiTFT 3.5" on a typical Kali Linux system:

```
./re4son-pi-tft-setup -t 35r -d /root
```

Press 'Y' when prompted to reboot.
